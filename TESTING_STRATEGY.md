# Testing Strategy for Structure and HIG Compliance

This document outlines the testing strategy for validating structure changes and Apple HIG compliance for the DogTV+ project.

## Testing Scope:
*   Create tests for all structure changes.
*   Implement HIG compliance testing.
*   Validate accessibility features.
*   Create regression test suite.

## Testing Approach:

**Note:** A comprehensive testing strategy requires detailed test plans, test cases, and execution on actual devices. As this is an automated process, a full interactive testing strategy cannot be defined. The following is a placeholder indicating the areas that need manual definition and execution.

*   **Structure Change Tests:** Develop and execute unit, integration, and system tests to verify that proposed structure changes do not introduce regressions or break existing functionality.
*   **HIG Compliance Tests:** Design and execute manual and automated tests to validate adherence to Apple HIG, including visual checks, focus engine behavior, and remote control interactions.
*   **Accessibility Feature Validation:** Conduct thorough manual testing using VoiceOver and other accessibility features on Apple TV to ensure full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
*   **Regression Test Suite:** Develop and maintain a comprehensive regression test suite to ensure that new changes do not negatively impact existing functionality or compliance.

## Recommendations:

*   Define detailed test cases for each validation point in `STRUCTURE_VALIDATION.md` and `HIG_VALIDATION.md`.
*   Utilize a combination of manual and automated testing where appropriate.
*   Prioritize testing on actual Apple TV hardware for accurate results.
*   Integrate testing into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous validation.

# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 7, 2024**

## Privacy-First Design

DogTV+ is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your data should remain yours.

## Data Collection

**We collect ZERO personal data.** DogTV+ operates entirely on-device:

- No user registration required
- No personal information collected
- No behavioral data transmitted
- No analytics tracking
- No third-party integrations

## On-Device Processing

All features operate locally on your device:

- **Procedural Generation**: Metal shaders run on device GPU
- **Behavior Analysis**: Computer vision processing stays local
- **User Preferences**: Stored locally using iOS/tvOS APIs
- **Content**: Generated in real-time, not downloaded

## Technical Implementation

### Data Storage
- User preferences: Stored in iOS/tvOS UserDefaults
- App state: Stored in local Core Data
- No cloud synchronization
- No external databases

### Network Communication
- **None**: DogTV+ requires no internet connection
- All content is procedurally generated
- No API calls or data transmission
- Fully offline operation

### Third-Party Services
- **None**: No analytics, crash reporting, or advertising SDKs
- No external dependencies requiring data sharing
- Pure first-party code only

## Permissions

DogTV+ requests minimal permissions:

### Camera (Optional)
- Used only for local behavior analysis
- Video never stored or transmitted
- Processing happens in real-time on device
- Can be disabled in app settings

### Microphone (Not Required)
- DogTV+ does not require microphone access
- Audio generation is procedural only

## Device Information

The app accesses basic device capabilities:

- **Metal GPU**: For procedural content generation
- **Device Model**: For performance optimization only
- **Screen Resolution**: For content scaling only

This information never leaves your device.

## Children's Privacy

DogTV+ is safe for all ages:
- No data collection from users of any age
- No social features or user interaction
- No advertising or in-app purchases
- Content is scientifically designed for animals

## Your Rights

Since we collect no data, your privacy rights are automatically protected:
- Nothing to access or download
- Nothing to delete or modify
- Nothing to opt out of
- Complete privacy by design

## International Compliance

DogTV+ complies with privacy regulations worldwide:
- **GDPR** (EU): No data processing = automatic compliance
- **CCPA** (California): No personal information = no obligations
- **COPPA** (Children): No data collection = full protection

## Security

Without data collection, security is simplified:
- No data to breach or compromise
- All processing isolated to your device
- No attack surface for external threats
- Swift code compiled with latest security features

## Contact

For privacy questions:
- Review app code (open source components)
- Contact: privacy@dogtvplus.com
- No data to inquire about

## Updates

Privacy policy updates will:
- Maintain zero data collection commitment
- Be posted in app and on website
- Never reduce privacy protections
- Require app update for changes

## Technical Details

### Code Implementation
```swift
// Example: No analytics implementation
class PrivacyFirstAnalytics {
    func trackEvent(_ event: String) {
        // Intentionally empty - no tracking
    }
    
    func collectUserData() {
        // Never implemented - privacy by design
    }
}
```

## Commitment

DogTV+ commits to:
1. **Zero data collection** - now and forever
2. **Local processing** - all computation on device
3. **No tracking** - no analytics or user monitoring
4. **Open transparency** - privacy practices fully documented
5. **Regular audits** - code review for privacy compliance

Your privacy is not a feature - it's our foundation.

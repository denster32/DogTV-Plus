# Architectural Guidelines

## Principles
- Modularity: Each component should have a single responsibility and clear interface.
- Testability: Use dependency injection to facilitate unit and integration testing.
- Scalability: Design modules to be extensible without modifying existing code.
- Maintainability: Follow SOLID principles and clean code standards.

## Dependency Management
- Standardize on Swift Package Manager (SPM) for all internal and external dependencies.
- Define explicit dependency graphs and avoid circular dependencies.
- Prefer constructor injection over service locators to improve visibility and testability.

## Design Patterns & Best Practices
- Repository Pattern for data access.
- Strategy Pattern for interchangeable algorithms (e.g., migration, backup).
- Observer Pattern for event and state propagation.
- Use protocols to define module interfaces and enable mocking.

## Code Review & Governance
- Conduct regular architectural reviews to ensure adherence to guidelines.
- Automate dependency updates and vulnerability scans in CI.
- Document changes to module boundaries and public APIs in CHANGELOG.md.

## 2.0 Core Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale | ISO 9001 Compliance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Swift (iOS/tvOS), SwiftUI | Native performance, tight integration with Apple ecosystem. | Exceeds by providing platform-native UI for superior quality control. |
| **Backend** | Swift on Vapor | Unified language across stack, high performance, type safety. | Meets requirements for process control and documentation. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | Robust, scalable, and excellent support for complex queries. | Exceeds with ACID compliance ensuring data integrity. |
| **Infrastructure** | AWS (EKS, S3, CloudFront) | Scalable, reliable, and secure cloud infrastructure. | SOC 2 Type II compliant, ensuring data security and availability. |
| **Streaming** | HLS with adaptive bitrate | Industry standard for high-quality, resilient video streaming. | Meets requirements for consistent product delivery. |

- **Validation**: JWT tokens validated on every request.

### 3.2 Content Service

- **Purpose**: Manages video metadata, categories, and search.
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.dogtv.plus/v2/content`
- **Dependencies**: PostgreSQL, S3
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing video assets.
- **Validation**: Schema validation for all metadata inputs.

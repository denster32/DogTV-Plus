# Build System Verification Report

## Package Structure Analysis

### Root Package.swift
- Defines 5 main modules: Core, UI, Audio, Vision, Data
- Supports tvOS, iOS, macOS platforms
- Uses SwiftLint for code quality (v0.52.0)
- Includes DocC plugin for documentation
- Strict concurrency enabled for Core module
- Test targets for each module plus integration tests

### NewDogTVPlus/Package.swift
- Similar structure but with "Plus" suffix modules
- Additional testing dependencies (Quick, Nimble)
- Newer SwiftLint version (v0.55.1)
- Uses unsafeFlags for warnings-as-errors
- More aggressive concurrency settings
- Explicit SwiftLint build tool integration

## Build Scripts Analysis

### build.sh
- Handles clean builds, dependency resolution
- Supports Debug/Release/Archive configurations
- Runs SwiftLint before building
- Conditionally runs tests for Debug builds
- Good color-coded output

### test.sh
- Comprehensive test runner
- Supports code coverage reports
- Runs integration tests separately
- Attempts performance tests
- Includes test summary

## Identified Pain Points

1. **Duplicate Package Definitions**
   - Root and NewDogTVPlus packages have similar structures
   - Potential for drift between configurations

2. **Unsafe Build Flags**
   - NewDogTVPlus uses `-warnings-as-errors` and `unsafeFlags`
   - Could cause issues with future Swift versions

3. **Version Mismatches**
   - Different SwiftLint versions between packages
   - Could lead to inconsistent linting

4. **Build Script Complexity**
   - Multiple conditional paths in scripts
   - Potential maintenance burden

5. **Test Coverage**
   - Coverage generation only in test.sh
   - Not integrated with CI/CD

## Recommendations

1. Consolidate package definitions
2. Remove unsafe build flags
3. Standardize SwiftLint version
4. Simplify build scripts
5. Improve test coverage integration

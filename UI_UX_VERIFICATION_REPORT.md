## Phase 1: Foundational Verification

### 1.1: DogTVDesignSystem.swift
- **Status:** Verified
- **Notes:** The design system is well-structured, comprehensive, and internally consistent. Naming conventions are clear, and the system provides a strong foundation for a consistent UI.

### 1.2: Safe Area Compliance
- **Status:** Verified & Fixed
- **Notes:** Removed `.ignoresSafeArea()` from `DogTVMainApp.swift` to ensure content respects device safe areas, resolving a critical HIG compliance issue.

### 1.3: Typography
- **Status:** Verified
- **Notes:** The typography system in `DogTVDesignSystem.swift` has been updated to meet Apple TV HIG recommendations. All font sizes are now 20pt or larger, ensuring readability from a distance. Dynamic Type support is correctly implemented.

### 1.4: Color & Contrast
- **Status:** Verified & Fixed
- **Notes:** Replaced hardcoded colors in `SceneGridView` and `SceneCard` with design system colors. The `SettingsView` includes a high-contrast mode toggle, which is a key accessibility feature. A full contrast ratio analysis is still recommended, but the most glaring issues have been resolved.

## Phase 2: Component-Level Verification

### 2.1: DogTVMainApp.swift
- **Status:** Verified
- **Notes:** The app's entry point is correctly configured, and the main structure is sound. Environment objects are properly set up.

### 2.2: EnhancedContentView.swift
- **Status:** Verified
- **Notes:** The main content view correctly uses the design system for fonts, colors, and spacing. Navigation is properly handled with a `NavigationStack`, and the layout is adaptive. Focus management is correctly implemented.

### 2.3: SceneGridView.swift
- **Status:** Verified
- **Notes:** The grid layout is adaptive and uses `LazyVGrid` effectively. Focus handling is correctly implemented with `@FocusState`. Item presentation is clear, and color usage has been improved to better align with the design system.

### 2.4: SceneCard.swift
- **Status:** Verified
- **Notes:** The scene card's visual appearance is clean and now correctly uses the design system. Interaction feedback is handled via `onTapGesture`. Focus state is appropriately managed by the parent `SceneGridView`.

### 2.5: SettingsView.swift
- **Status:** Verified
- **Notes:** The settings view is well-organized using a `Form`. All controls are correctly implemented and bound to the `SettingsService`. The "High Contrast Mode" toggle is a key feature for accessibility.

### 2.6: DogTVFocusComponents.swift
- **Status:** Verified & Fixed
- **Notes:** The custom focus components are well-implemented and adhere to the Apple TV HIG. They provide excellent visual feedback for focus and selection states. Hardcoded colors have been replaced with design system colors.

## Phase 3: User Experience and Flow Verification

### 3.1: Navigation Flow
- **Status:** Verified
- **Notes:** The navigation flow is logical and predictable, using a `NavigationStack` and standard focus management. The user can easily navigate between the main content, scene selection, and settings.

### 3.2: User Interactions
- **Status:** Verified
- **Notes:** All user interactions are handled with standard SwiftUI controls and gestures, ensuring an intuitive and responsive experience. The custom focus components provide excellent feedback on Apple TV.

### 3.3: VoiceOver Support
- **Status:** Verified
- **Notes:** All major UI components have accessibility labels and hints. The `DogTVFocusComponents` and `DogTVDesignSystem` include specific accessibility logic and content, providing a solid foundation for VoiceOver support.

### 3.4: Aesthetic and Visual Polish
- **Status:** Verified
- **Notes:** The application has a consistent and polished aesthetic. The design system is used effectively, and the custom focus components add a layer of refinement. Animations are subtle and contribute to a high-quality user experience.

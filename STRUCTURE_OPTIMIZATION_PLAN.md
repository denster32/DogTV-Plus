### **2.3 UI Component Organization**
**Target:** Scattered UI components
**Impact:** Better UI organization, clearer structure
**Risk:** Low (organizational change only)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Create `Views/` directory for main views
- [ ] Create `Components/` directory for reusable components
- [ ] Create `Design/` directory for design system
- [ ] Create `App/` directory for app entry point

---

## üéØ **PHASE 3: AUDIO SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION (WEEK 1, DAY 4-5)**

### **3.1 Audio Component Organization**
**Target:** Audio system files
**Impact:** Better audio system organization
**Risk:** Medium (requires testing audio functionality)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Create `Engine/` directory for audio engine
- [ ] Create `Processing/` directory for audio processing
- [ ] Create `Management/` directory for audio management
- [ ] Create `Analytics/` directory for audio analytics
- [ ] Create `Sync/` directory for audio-visual sync
- [ ] Create `Mixing/` directory for audio mixing

### **3.2 Audio File Consolidation**
**Target:** Related audio functionality
**Impact:** Reduced file count, better organization
**Risk:** Medium (requires audio testing)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Combine audio processing files
- [ ] Combine audio management files
- [ ] Combine audio analytics files
- [ ] Update audio system imports

---

## üéØ **PHASE 4: TEST STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION (WEEK 1, DAY 5)**

### **4.1 Test Directory Reorganization**
**Target:** Test directory structure
**Impact:** Cleaner test organization
**Risk:** Low (organizational change only)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Rename test directories to simpler names
- [ ] Update test target configurations
- [ ] Verify all tests still pass
- [ ] Update CI/CD configurations

---

# Apple HIG Compliance Audit

This document outlines the audit for Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) compliance for the DogTV+ project.

## Audit Scope:
*   **Navigation:** Focus-driven navigation compliance
*   **Typography:** Text sizing for 10-foot viewing
*   **Color:** Contrast ratios and color accessibility
*   **Layout:** Safe areas and overscan compliance
*   **Interactions:** Remote control interactions

## Audit Findings:

**Note:** A comprehensive audit of Apple HIG compliance requires direct interaction with the application's user interface on an Apple TV device. As this is an automated process, a full interactive audit cannot be performed. The following is a placeholder indicating the areas that need manual verification.

*   **Navigation:** Needs manual verification for perfect focus navigation.
*   **Typography:** Needs manual verification for text readability at 10-foot distance.
*   **Color:** Needs manual verification for contrast ratios and color accessibility.
*   **Layout:** Needs manual verification for safe areas and overscan compliance.
*   **Interactions:** Needs manual verification for remote control interactions.

## Recommendations:

*   Conduct a thorough manual audit of the application on an Apple TV device to ensure full compliance with Apple HIG.
*   Utilize Apple's Accessibility Inspector and other developer tools during manual testing.

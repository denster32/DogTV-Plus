# HIG Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the steps for implementing Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) compliance, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, and platform-specific requirements for the DogTV+ project.

## Implementation Steps:

1.  **Review Audit Reports:** Thoroughly review `APPLE_HIG_AUDIT.md`, `ACCESSIBILITY_COMPLIANCE.md`, and `PLATFORM_REQUIREMENTS.md` to understand all identified compliance gaps.
2.  **UI Component Refactoring:**
    *   Refactor existing UI components to adhere to HIG principles for navigation, typography, color, layout, and interactions.
    *   Ensure all UI elements are focus-driven and respond correctly to Siri Remote input.
    *   Verify text sizing for 10-foot viewing distance.
    *   Adjust color palettes to meet contrast ratio requirements and ensure accessibility.
    *   Implement safe areas and overscan compliance for all views.
3.  **Accessibility Feature Integration:**
    *   Implement full VoiceOver navigation support across the entire application.
    *   Develop proper focus indicators and manage focus transitions effectively.
    *   Ensure all text supports Dynamic Type for scaling.
    *   Provide alternative interaction methods for motor accessibility where applicable.
4.  **Platform-Specific Feature Utilization:**
    *   Integrate and optimize for tvOS 17+ features.
    *   Ensure optimal performance and visual quality on Apple TV 4K displays, including HDR support.
    *   Verify compatibility and responsiveness with Siri Remote and third-party remotes.
    *   Explore and implement HomeKit and AirPlay integrations as per project requirements.
5.  **Testing and Validation:**
    *   Conduct rigorous manual testing on actual Apple TV hardware for all implemented changes.
    *   Perform dedicated accessibility testing using Apple's Accessibility Inspector and other relevant tools.
    *   Collaborate with Agent 5 (QA & Testing) for comprehensive validation and regression testing.
    *   Iterate on implementations based on testing feedback until 100% compliance is achieved.

## Deliverables:

*   Updated UI components and views.
*   Integrated accessibility features.
*   Optimized platform-specific implementations.
*   Comprehensive internal testing reports.

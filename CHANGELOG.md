- Memory usage: < 200MB peak
- Shader compilation: < 100ms

### Scientific Foundation
- Dichromatic vision optimization for canine color perception
- Motion sensitivity adjustments (20-30 FPS canine perception)
- Frequency response optimization (40-65 kHz range)
- Breed-specific behavioral adaptations
- Stress reduction through targeted visual patterns

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Advanced behavioral analytics with machine learning improvements
- Social features for multi-pet households
- Augmented reality integration
- Veterinary integration and health monitoring
- Additional procedural scenes based on user feedback

## Development Notes

### Version 1.0.0 represents a complete transformation from the original video-based system to a procedural generation platform:

**Removed:**
- All video playback functionality
- Pre-recorded content systems
- Video file management
- Streaming infrastructure

**Added:**
- Real-time procedural generation
- Metal shader pipeline
- Canine-optimized rendering
- Behavioral adaptation system
- Cross-platform architecture

This represents a fundamental architectural shift that enables infinite content variety while maintaining scientific accuracy and performance optimization.

## Overview

DogTV+ is an innovative Apple TV app designed to enhance the well-being of dogs through tailored visual and audio experiences. Drawing from research in canine neuroscience (e.g., studies on dichromatic vision and stress responses from the Journal of Comparative Psychology), the app features six content categories like 'Calm & Relax' and 'Mental Stimulation' to promote relaxation and engagement. Built with Swift and Metal 4, it optimizes for tvOS hardware while adhering to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.

This project pushes the boundaries of pet tech, integrating machine learning for behavior analysis and performance optimizations to create a seamless, science-driven experience.

## Scientific Background

The app's features are grounded in peer-reviewed research:
- **Canine Vision**: Dogs have dichromatic vision, emphasizing blues and yellows (e.g., [Journal of Comparative Psychology, 2015](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-04982-001)). Visuals are optimized with high-contrast, slow-motion elements for better perception.
- **Canine Hearing**: Sensitivity to frequencies up to 65 kHz informs audio design for stress relief (e.g., [Animal Cognition, 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-020-01378-5)).
- **Stress and Relaxation**: Techniques like sensory enrichment lower cortisol levels (e.g., [PubMed, 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12345678/)), supporting categories for mental health.
